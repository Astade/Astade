Known bugs:

- "edit" should be the first entry in the context menu for "makefile"
- The dialog for the user applications doesn't work under Windows
- A copied parameter is not added to the repository
- A copied Makefile is not added to the repository
- If you add a prolog or epilog, the tree is not updated correct

Issues:

- There should be a "trace level" for each operation which is coded into the trace macro
- "Run" should not block the tree
- It should be possible to interrupt the build
- The icon update is slow for components and should be a separate thread
- copy and paste has to be checked for all elements.
- There should be a "recent" file list in the open dialog
