Known bugs:

- A copied parameter is not added to the repository
- A copied Makefile is not added to the repository
- A copied state misses the entry functions
- If you add a prolog or epilog, the tree is not updated correctly
- If you remove from active component, the source is not deleted in "auto"
- "regenerate all" is extremely slow (AstadeGenerate is _much_ faster)
- If accidentially parts of a model are not under source-control while the rest
  of the model is, interesting errors may occur
- The state-chart coders ignore prologues and epilogues (also component-level)

Issues:

- "Run" should not block the tree
- It should be possible to interrupt the build
- copy and paste has to be checked for all elements.
- There should be a "search in model" function
