Known bugs:

- A copied parameter is not added to the repository
- A copied Makefile is not added to the repository
- If you add a prolog or epilog, the tree is not updated correctly
- If you remove from active component, the source is not deleted in "auto"
- Copy an inline operation does not copy the inline attribute

Issues:

- "Run" should not block the tree
- It should be possible to interrupt the build
- copy and paste has to be checked for all elements.
