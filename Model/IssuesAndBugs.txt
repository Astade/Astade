Known bugs:

- If you add a prolog or epilog, the tree is not updated correctly
- If you remove from active component, the source is not deleted in "auto"
- If accidentially parts of a model are not under source-control while the rest
  of the model is, interesting errors may occur
- The state-chart coders ignore prologues and epilogues (also component-level)
- the ResourceEdit allows to make a static operation const (the compiler does
  not)

Issues:

- AstadeFrame::CopyMakefile performs some action that should be done by the API.
- "Run" should not block the tree
- It should be possible to interrupt the build
- copy and paste has to be checked for all elements.
- There should be a "search in model" function
- There should be the possibility to convert an attribute to a relation and
  vice versa.
- There should be a simple possibility to import legacy code
- The coder should not change the filedate of the headerfiles,
  if the new content is the same as before. This would increase compile speed!

Features/Proposals:

- Interface Classes: C++ pure abstract class, Java knows special interfaces
- Implements-Relation: clearly show in UML that a class implements an interface
  (see above)
  (perhaps Astade can auto-generate abstract operations from base classes and
  interfaces on demand)
- Template Classes: in C++ template class, in Java generic class, aso.
