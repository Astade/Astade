Description=wxFindReplaceDialog is a standard modeless dialog which is used to allow the user to search for some text (and possibly replace it with something else). The actual searching is supposed to be done in the owner window which is the parent of this dialog. Note that it means that unlike for the other standard dialogs this one must have a parent window. Also note that there is no way to use this dialog in a modal way; it is always, by design and implementation, modeless.
