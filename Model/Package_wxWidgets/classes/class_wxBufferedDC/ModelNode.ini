Description=This simple class provides a simple way to avoid flicker: when drawing on it, everything is in fact first drawn on an in-memory buffer (a wxBitmap) and then copied to the screen only once, when this object is destroyed.\n\nIt can be used in the same way as any other device context. wxBufferedDC itself typically replaces wxClientDC, if you want to use it in your OnPaint() handler, you should look at wxBufferedPaintDC.
