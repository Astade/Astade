Description=This class encapsulates a platform-independent image. An image can be created from data, or using wxBitmap::ConvertToImage. An image can be loaded from a file in a variety of formats, and is extensible to new formats via image format handlers. Functions are available to set and get image bits, so it can be used for basic image manipulation.
