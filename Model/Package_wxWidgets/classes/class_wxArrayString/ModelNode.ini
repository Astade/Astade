Description=wxArrayString is an efficient container for storing wxString objects. It has the same features as all wxArray classes, i.e. it dynamically expands when new items are added to it (so it is as easy to use as a linked list), but the access time to the elements is constant, instead of being linear in number of elements as in the case of linked lists. It is also very size efficient and doesn't take more space than a C array wxString[] type (wxArrayString uses its knowledge of internals of wxString class to achieve this).
