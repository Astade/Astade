Description=wxFindReplaceData holds the data for wxFindReplaceDialog. It is used to initialize the dialog with the default values and will keep the last values from the dialog when it is closed. It is also updated each time a wxFindDialogEvent is generated so instead of using the wxFindDialogEvent methods you can also directly query this object.\n\nNote that all SetXXX() methods may only be called before showing the dialog and calling them has no effect later.
