Description=The wxHTML library uses a virtual file systems mechanism similar to the one used in Midnight Commander, Dos Navigator, FAR or almost any modern file manager. It allows the user to access data stored in archives as if they were ordinary files. On-the-fly generated files that exist only in memory are also supported.\n\nClasses\n\nThree classes are used in order to provide virtual file systems mechanism:\n\n\nThe wxFSFile class provides information about opened file (name, input stream, mime type and anchor). \nThe wxFileSystem class is the interface. Its main methods are ChangePathTo() and OpenFile(). This class is most often used by the end user. \nThe wxFileSystemHandler is the core of virtual file systems mechanism. You can derive your own handler and pass it to the VFS mechanism. You can derive your own handler and pass it to wxFileSystem's AddHandler() method. In the new handler you only need to override the OpenFile() and CanOpen() methods.
