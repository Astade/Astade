Description=The wxTextFile is a simple class which allows to work with text files on line by line basis. It also understands the differences in line termination characters under different platforms and will not do anything bad to files with "non native" line termination sequences - in fact, it can be also used to modify the text files and change the line termination characters from one type (say DOS) to another (say Unix).\n\nOne word of warning: the class is not at all optimized for big files and thus it will load the file entirely into memory when opened. Of course, you should not work in this way with large files (as an estimation, anything over 1 Megabyte is surely too big for this class). On the other hand, it is not a serious limitation for small files like configuration files or program sources which are well handled by wxTextFile.
