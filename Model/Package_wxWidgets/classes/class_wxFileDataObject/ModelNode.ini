Description=wxFileDataObject is a specialization of wxDataObject for file names. The program works with it just as if it were a list of absolute file names, but internally it uses the same format as Explorer and other compatible programs under Windows or GNOME/KDE filemanager under Unix which makes it possible to receive files from them using this class.
