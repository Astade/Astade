Description=A wxFile performs raw file I/O. This is a very small class designed to minimize the overhead of using it - in fact, there is hardly any overhead at all, but using it brings you automatic error checking and hides differences between platforms and compilers. wxFile also automatically closes the file in its destructor making it unnecessary to worry about forgetting to do it. wxFile is a wrapper around file descriptor. - see also wxFFile for a wrapper around FILE structure.\n\nwxFileOffset is used by the wxFile functions which require offsets as parameter or return them. If the platform supports it, wxFileOffset if a typedef for a native 64 bit integer, else a 32 bit integer is used for wxFileOffset.
