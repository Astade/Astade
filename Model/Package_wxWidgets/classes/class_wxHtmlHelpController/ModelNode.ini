Description=WARNING! Although this class has an API compatible with other wxWidgets help controllers as documented by wxHelpController, it is recommended that you use the enhanced capabilities of wxHtmlHelpController's API.\n\nThis help controller provides an easy way of displaying HTML help in your application (see test sample). The help system is based on books (see AddBook). A book is a logical section of documentation (for example "User's Guide" or "Programmer's Guide" or "C++ Reference" or "wxWidgets Reference"). The help controller can handle as many books as you want.\n\nwxHTML uses Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop project files (.hhp, .hhk, .hhc) as its native format. The file format is described here. Have a look at docs/html/ directory where sample project files are stored
