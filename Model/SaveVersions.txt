The differences in the save versions:

1 - Initial save version
2 - Repository MKS is supported
3 - There are mixed C and C++ classes
4 - We use "code.c" instead of "code.cpp" for actions in C classes
5 - There is a new node type: "Terminate transition" inside statecharts
6 - A generalisation can take a default value
7 - statecharts may contain transitions, which are treated as "default" transition in any state
