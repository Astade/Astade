Description=wxSemaphore is a counter limiting the number of threads concurrently accessing a shared resource. This counter is always between 0 and the maximum value specified during the semaphore creation. When the counter is strictly greater than 0, a call to Wait returns immediately and decrements the counter. As soon as it reaches 0, any subsequent calls to Wait block and only return when the semaphore counter becomes strictly positive again as the result of calling Post which increments the counter.\n\nIn general, semaphores are useful to restrict access to a shared resource which can only be accessed by some fixed number of clients at the same time. For example, when modeling a hotel reservation system a semaphore with the counter equal to the total number of available rooms could be created. Each time a room is reserved, the semaphore should be acquired by calling Wait and each time a room is freed it should be released by calling Post.
