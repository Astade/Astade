Description=A wxDC is a device context onto which graphics and text can be drawn. It is intended to represent a number of output devices in a generic way, so a window can have a device context associated with it, and a printer also has a device context. In this way, the same piece of code may write to a number of different devices, if the device context is used as a parameter.\n\nDerived types of wxDC have documentation for specific features only, so refer to this section for most device context information.\n\nPlease note that in addition to the versions of the methods documented here, there are also versions which accept single wxPoint parameter instead of two wxCoord ones or wxPoint and wxSize instead of four of them.
