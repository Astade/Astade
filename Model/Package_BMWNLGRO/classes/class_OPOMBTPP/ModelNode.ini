Description=This is the root class of all wxWidgets classes. It declares a virtual destructor which ensures that destructors get called for all derived class objects where necessary.\n\nwxObject is the hub of a dynamic object creation scheme, enabling a program to create instances of a class only knowing its string class name, and to query the class hierarchy.\n\nThe class contains optional debugging versions of new and delete, which can help trace memory allocation and deallocation problems.\n\nwxObject can be used to implement reference counted objects, such as wxPen, wxBitmap and others.
