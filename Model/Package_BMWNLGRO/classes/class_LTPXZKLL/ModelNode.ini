Description=wxConfigBase class defines the basic interface of all config classes. It can not be used by itself (it is an abstract base class) and you will always use one of its derivations: wxFileConfig, wxRegConfig or any other.\n\nHowever, usually you don't even need to know the precise nature of the class you're working with but you would just use the wxConfigBase methods. This allows you to write the same code regardless of whether you're working with the registry under Win32 or text-based config files under Unix (or even Windows 3.1 .INI files if you're really unlucky). To make writing the portable code even easier, wxWidgets provides a typedef wxConfig which is mapped onto the native wxConfigBase implementation on the given platform: i.e. wxRegConfig under Win32 and wxFileConfig otherwise.
