Description=wxLog class defines the interface for the log targets used by wxWidgets logging functions as explained in the wxLog overview. The only situations when you need to directly use this class is when you want to derive your own log target because the existing ones don't satisfy your needs. Another case is if you wish to customize the behaviour of the standard logging classes (all of which respect the wxLog settings): for example, set which trace messages are logged and which are not or change (or even remove completely) the timestamp on the messages.\n\nOtherwise, it is completely hidden behind the wxLogXXX() functions and you may not even know about its existence.
