Description=A flex grid sizer is a sizer which lays out its children in a two-dimensional table with all table fields in one row having the same height and all fields in one column having the same width, but all rows or all columns are not necessarily the same height or width as in the wxGridSizer.\n\nSince wxWidgets 2.5.0, wxFlexGridSizer can also size items equally in one direction but unequally ("flexibly") in the other. If the sizer is only flexible in one direction (this can be changed using SetFlexibleDrection), it needs to be decided how the sizer should grow in the other ("non flexible") direction in order to fill the available space. The SetNonFlexibleGrowMode method serves this purpose.
