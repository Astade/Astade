Description=A menu is a popup (or pull down) list of items, one of which may be selected before the menu goes away (clicking elsewhere dismisses the menu). Menus may be used to construct either menu bars or popup menus.\n\nA menu item has an integer ID associated with it which can be used to identify the selection, or to change the menu item in some way. A menu item with a special identifier -1 is a separator item and doesn't have an associated command but just makes a separator line appear in the menu.
