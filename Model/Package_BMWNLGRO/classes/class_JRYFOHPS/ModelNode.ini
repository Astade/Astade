Description=A class that can handle events from the windowing system. wxWindow (and therefore all window classes) are derived from this class.\n\nWhen events are received, wxEvtHandler invokes the method listed in the event table using itself as the object. When using multiple inheritance it is imperative that the wxEvtHandler(-derived) class be the first class inherited such that the "this" pointer for the overall object will be identical to the "this" pointer for the wxEvtHandler portion.
