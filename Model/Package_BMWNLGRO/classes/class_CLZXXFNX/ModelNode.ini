Description=The wxTimer class allows you to execute code at specified intervals. Its precision is platform-dependent, but in general will not be better than 1ms nor worse than 1s.\n\nThere are two different ways to use this class:\n\n\nYou may derive a new class from wxTimer and override the Notify member to perform the required action. \nOr you may redirect the notifications to any wxEvtHandler derived object by using the non default constructor or SetOwner. Then use the EVT_TIMER macro to connect it to the event handler which will receive wxTimerEvent notifications. \nOr you may use a derived class and the EVT_TIMER macro to connect it to an event handler defined in the derived class. If the default constructor is used, the timer object will be its own owner object, since it is derived from wxEvtHandler. \nIn any case, you must start the timer with Start after constructing it before it actually starts sending notifications. It can be stopped later with Stop.\n\nNB: note that timer can only be used from the main thread currently.
