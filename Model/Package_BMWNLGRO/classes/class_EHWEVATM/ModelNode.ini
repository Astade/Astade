Description=Pops up a file selector box. In Windows and GTK2.4+, this is the common file selector dialog. In X, this is a file selector box with somewhat less functionality. The path and filename are distinct elements of a full file pathname. If path is "", the current directory will be used. If filename is "", no default filename will be supplied. The wildcard determines what files are displayed in the file selector, and file extension supplies a type extension for the required filename. Flags may be a combination of wxOPEN, wxSAVE, wxOVERWRITE_PROMPT, wxHIDE_READONLY, wxFILE_MUST_EXIST, wxMULTIPLE, wxCHANGE_DIR or 0.
