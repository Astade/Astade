Description=A wxDataObject represents data that can be copied to or from the clipboard, or dragged and dropped. The important thing about wxDataObject is that this is a 'smart' piece of data unlike 'dumb' data containers such as memory buffers or files. Being 'smart' here means that the data object itself should know what data formats it supports and how to render itself in each of its supported formats.
