Description=The objects of this class are used in conjunction with the wxExecute function. When a wxProcess object is passed to wxExecute(), its OnTerminate() virtual method is called when the process terminates. This allows the program to be (asynchronously) notified about the process termination and also retrieve its exit status which is unavailable from wxExecute() in the case of asynchronous execution.\n\nPlease note that if the process termination notification is processed by the parent, it is responsible for deleting the wxProcess object which sent it. However, if it is not processed, the object will delete itself and so the library users should only delete those objects whose notifications have been processed (and call Detach() for others).\n\nwxProcess also supports IO redirection of the child process. For this, you have to call its Redirect method before passing it to wxExecute. If the child process was launched successfully, GetInputStream, GetOutputStream and GetErrorStream can then be used to retrieve the streams corresponding to the child process standard output, input and error output respectively.
