Description=A static bitmap control displays a bitmap. It is meant for display of the small icons in the dialog boxes and is not meant to be a general purpose image display control. In particular, under Windows 9x the size of bitmap is limited to 64*64 pixels and thus you should use your own control if you want to display larger images portably.
