Description=A frame is a window whose size and position can (usually) be changed by the user. It usually has thick borders and a title bar, and can optionally contain a menu bar, toolbar and status bar. A frame can contain any window that is not a frame or dialog.\n\nA frame that has a status bar and toolbar created via the CreateStatusBar/CreateToolBar functions manages these windows, and adjusts the value returned by GetClientSize to reflect the remaining size available to application windows.
