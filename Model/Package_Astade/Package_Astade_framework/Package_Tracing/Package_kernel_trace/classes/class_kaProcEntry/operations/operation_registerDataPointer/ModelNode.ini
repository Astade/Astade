Description=When a large number of almost identical files is used, itâ€™s quite inconvenient to use a\nseparate call back function for each file. A better approach is to have a single call back\nfunction that distinguishes between the files by using the data field in struct.\n\nThis function is used to initialize the Data field.\n\nThe data field is a void *, so it can be initialised with anything.\nNow that the data field is set, the read_proc and write_proc can use it to\ndistinguish between files because they get it passed into their data parameter.
