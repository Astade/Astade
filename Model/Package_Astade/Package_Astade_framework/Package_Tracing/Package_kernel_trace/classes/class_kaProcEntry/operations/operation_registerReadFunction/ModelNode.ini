Description=The read function is a call back function that allows userland processes to read data\nfrom the kernel. The read function should have the following format:\n\nint read_func(char* page, char** start, off_t off, int count, int* eof, void* data);\n\nThe read function should write its information into the page. For proper use, the\nfunction should start writing at an offset of off in page and write at most count\nbytes, but because most read functions are quite simple and only return a small amount\nof information, these two parameters are usually ignored (it breaks pagers like more\nand less, but cat still works).\n\nIf the "off" and "count" parameters are properly used, "eof" should be used to signal that\nthe end of the file has been reached by writing 1 to the memory location eof points to.\n\nThe parameter "start" doesn't seem to be used anywhere in the kernel. \n\nThe "data" parameter can be used to create a single call back function for several files, see Section\n\nThe read_func function must return the number of bytes written into the page.
