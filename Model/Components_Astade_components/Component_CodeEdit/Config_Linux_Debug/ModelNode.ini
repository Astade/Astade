Description=You have to install wxWidgets with wxScintilla-wrapper from contrib/src/stc/. This part is not installed automatically, if you build/install wxWidgets from source.\n\nWhether your linux distribtion provides a wxWidgets package with STC installed you can check. Yerify you have a library like /usr/lib/libwx_gtk2_stc-2.8.so or something similar. The name of this library depends on your local environment, e.g. version number or toolkit may vary. \n\nIf your distribution package does not provide STC you have to install it by hand. Goold luck ;)
