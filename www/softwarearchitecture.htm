<h2>The Components&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The software package &quot;astade&quot; consists of a lot of separate
programs (components). each of the will be described here:</p>
<h3>Astade</h3>
<p>This is the main part of the package. All model changes are done with that
program. You can add and remove model elements with that component. And, of
course, see all the model elements.</p>
<p>At the end, this component, is a specialized directory viewer, because each
model element will be mapped to an element in the file structure of the
operating system. Elements which can contain other elements (like classes) are
folders. Elements which don't contain other elements (like attributes) are
files.</p>
<p>All files are text files in the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxwidgeds</a>
.ini format.</p>
<p>If you like to see some screenshots, you'll find them <a href="screenshots.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h3>FeatureDialog</h3>
<p>Every model element has a configuration dialog (feature dialog). In that
dialog you can modify the features of the model element. So there are a lot of
components, which allow the modification of a specific model element.</p>
<p>That means, there is one component for every model element (which actually
edits the corresponding .ini file).</p>
<h3>OMDViewe</h3>
<p>The OMDView generates text files in the .dot format from any point of the
model tree. Thease files are interpreted by grapgwiz and converted into object
model diagrams.</p>
<h3>CodeGenerator</h3>
<p>The Code Generator takes a folder (which is actually a class, from the model
point of view) and all files and subfolders with all the .ini stuff and generates
a valid .cpp and .h file in it.</p>
<p>Because each model element has also a &quot;comment&quot;, the CodeGenerator
writes well documented and <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">doxygen</a>
compatible source.</p>
<h3>MakefileGenerator</h3>
<p>There are model elements which are called &quot;components&quot;. At the end,
they are lists of classes, which shall exist in a certain binary (program or
lib). The MakefileGenerator use these list and generates a makefile, so the
&quot;make&quot; will be able to generates the component (the program).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reporter</h3>
<p>The Reporter reads also the model Elements called &quot;component&quot; and
generates a project file for <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen">doxygen</a>.
because the source files are already well documented, the documentation of the
program is ready too.</p>
