<p>This project develops a UML tool from scratch. If you want to
learn something about model based development, participation in this project
might teach you a lot.</p>
<p>Or, on the other hand, if you already know a lot about it but have not yet found
a perfect tool, your knowledge is very welcome, too. If you can help make
astade be how a UML tool <i>should</i> be, you get something valuable which you
can later use for your own software projects.</p>
<p>If you want to join the project, you are very welcome no matter what your
reasons for contribution are. The following tasks have to be done next. Maybe
something is interesting for you?</p>
<h3>FeatureDialog</h3>
<p>If you have some experience in programming user dialogs with <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>,
or want to get some, maybe the FeatureDialog is a job for you. The goal is a
simple dialog application in C++, which uses the class library to realize a comfortable
possibility for editing the model elements of astade.</p>
<p>The existing FeatureDialog may be used as an example.</p>
<h3>CodeGenerator</h3>
<p>The CodeGenerator scans the astade model elements and writes .cpp and .h
files. This is a job for an experienced C++ programmer who likes to find
elegant solutions and is familiar with the STL and various design patterns.</p>
<p>Astade shall produce code which is correct (of course), efficient, elegant, <b>readable</b>,
and well documented. If you love &quot;beautiful&quot; code, this might be the
job for you.</p>
<h3>Astade</h3>
<p>The treeview already works. But there is still a lot to do! &quot;Drag and
drop&quot; of sub trees, &quot;copy and paste&quot; them, online help and so on.
Everything which makes designer's life comfortable.</p>
<p>If you like GUIs and have fun making them nice and pretty, maybe you would
like to help here?</p>
<h3>Graphic design</h3>
<p>If you like graphic design, the optical design of a software and you want to
contribute some logos and icons, well, there is also need for that.</p>
<h3>Software design</h3>
<p>If you have good ideas how things should be done, join the project. Things
get better if they are thouroughly discussed already in the beginning.</p>
