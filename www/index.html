<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is, to develop an UML tool where you can develop at
model level and get automatic source code for C++.
</p>

<p>The program shall&nbsp; be a complete frontend (GUI) for software development
(in C++) which can be customized for any compiler.
</p>

<p>At the first look, this seems to be a big deal. But combining some tools,
already available, it will be possible!
</p>

<p>The main ideas to minimize afford are;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the model tree is build in the directory structure of the operating
    system.</li>
  <li>all graphics are done with graphviz</li>
  <li>the documentation is done with doxygen</li>
</ul>
<p>So we and up with al litte &quot;user dialog&quot; and a good &quot;code
generator&quot;, that should be possible.</p>
<h3>Why reinvent the wheel?</h3>
<p>After working with an UML tool for over a year now in my job I've learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its great, to work with an UML tool. You'll never want to write source
    code by hand, after that experiance!</li>
  <li>Commercial tools are expensive! Really!</li>
  <li>Open source tools are not really usabel yet :-(</li>
  <li>Both, the comercial and the open source ones, are to complicate. You will
    see that, if you see how simple astade works at the end.</li>
</ul>
